# Disintegrated Love and Integrated Ego

What it means when **I** die? question is, who is **I** here. What is it that makes up I? Is there some boundary to what is I and what is not I. Is the boundary of this body to this world separates I and not I. But this body isn't same always, biologically I is losing skin cells every minute. So mathematically I doesn't remain same as I were a minute ago, in-fact after losing cells I has gained maybe more skin cells now. So can the separation of I and not I be accounted quantitatively? Even quantitatively I is either in reduced or in additive state but hardly in same state. Does that change the definition of separation then? 



Is this I in context to my current self of what I'm right now, would I be same after one minute or one second. Well biologically millions of cells would have been dead in the second past away, and new cells been created.
