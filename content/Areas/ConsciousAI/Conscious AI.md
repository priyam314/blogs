## Introduction

 <p style="text-align:center;"><b>Three levels of Intelligence</b></p>

- **Mechanical**
  Corresponds to repetitive tasks that require consistency and accuracy, e.g. order-taking machines in restaurants or robots in manufacturing assembly processes.

- **Analytical**
  Corresponds to less routine task, but the one which is more inclined towards classification side (e.g., credit application determinations, market segmentation, revenue predictions, etc.) 
- **Empathy, Intution and Creativity**
  Few AI applications exist at this level. Although empathy and intution are *believed* to be directly related to human consciousness. 

Progression of AI into higher intelligence task can fundamentally disrupt the service industry and severely affect employment and business models as AI agents will replace more humans. 

---

## Goals of Paper

- Focus on what is required for such conscious state to arise and how we can recognize conscious machines.

- Putting forward a theory on how consciousness would emerge in its primitive state in AI agents 
	- with that, it will also put forward how conscious AI may progress towards a point that we can *deterministically* recognize it as conscious AI.

- Advancing our understanding of Empathic AI as final stage of intelligence.

---

## Preliminary Observation

- Turing (1950) introduced a test that later became known as the Turing Test to pinpoint when it can be said a machine (a standard computational machine) is capable of thinking.

- The Turing Test can identify *thinking machines* only at their maturity when they have achieved linguistic indistinguishability from humans

- Research on consciousness is vast and involves many scientific disciplines (e.g. sociology, neurology, psychology, pathology, philosophy, physics etc)

---

## Proposition

- Principled framework that can identify *thinking machines* through their path toward maturity along with minimum requirements under which machine consciousness can emerge.

- Consciousness in AI is **emergent** phenomenon that manifests when two machines co-create their own language through which they can communicate their internal state.

## Intelligent Machines

|Weak AI|Strong AI|
|:-:|:-:|
|Information-processing machines that appear to possess full range of human cognitive abilities|Defined as intelligent machines that possess all mental and comparable physical capabilities of humans, including consciousness using advanced computation|

Authors argue that form of Strong AI with an emergent consciousness is possible

## Consciousness Theories

> Theories focusing on mind, and it's states

### Philo-Psychological theories of Consciousness

Primarily concerned about what consciousness is and how it comes to be within a conscious entity (human).

Entities that play significant role in philo-psychological theories
- structure of mind

- mental states

- way information is processed, retrieved and stored.

Main focus on `internal processes` while acknowledging the entity's environment as a source of stimuli.

</br>

#### Representationalism

<p>&nbsp;</p>

```goat

			| 
Representationalism --> [Higher Order]   .---> [Intentional]
			|                                    |

			 							                            '---> [Phenomenal]	
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Philosophical idea of representationalism reduces consciousness to *mental representations* of objects in environment such as photos, signs, natural objects and their qualities. 

|Intentional|Phenomenal|
|:-:|:-:|
|Mental State when it is about, or directed at some object|Feeling of what it's like to be you|
|e.g. Belief that Earth is round, thought about laptop, perception of animal|e.g. Perceptual experiences, pains, emotional feelings, episodes of mental imagery, deja vu|

        </td>      
    </tr>
</table>  

</br>

##### First-Order Representationalism

- Core idea is that any conscious state is a  *representation* and what it's like to be in a conscious state is entirely determined by the *content* of that representation
	
- A representation is about something, and the content of that representation is what the representation is about

- E.g. word `DOLPHINS` (*representation*) is about `dolphins` (*content*)

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p style="text-align:center;"><b>Three Classifications are in Order</b></p>

1. **Though a representation has content, a representation is not identical to its content**

   The representation `DOLPHINS` is an English word with eight letters, but its content `dolphins` does not have any letters. Conversely, dolphins swim, but the word `DOLPHINS` does not swim.

2. **The content of a representation can be false, and can concern a non-existent thing**

   - The story of *Snow White* is about someone who does not exist, but younger children sometimes find it hard to distinguish between the *reality* and *fantasy*

   - According to representationalists, this explains why illusions, dreams, and hallucinations are possible
   - Consciousness can misrepresent the world

3. **First-Order Representationalism does not hold that every contentful representation is conscious**

   Conscious Representation must be poised to interact directly with oneâ€™s beliefs and desires

</br>

##### Higher-Order Representationalism

- Address the shortcomings of first-order representationalism by differentiating betweeen conscious and unconscious mental states. 

- It says, mental state is only considered conscious when another mental state within same conscious entity is aware of it. 
	- For example, entity's desire to express opinion becomes conscious only when entity is aware of such a desire. 
	
	- Tongue in person's mouth is aware of it and shows desires and sends signals to brain if it needs to taste something sweet or so.

</br>

#### Observations

- These theories do not offer external observers a direct way of knowing whether they are dealing with conscious entity.

- Based on these theories, conscious entity may itself know that it is consciouss, but external observer (e.g. human) would not be able to know until that conscious entity inform itself.


>Theory is needed that can potentially offer external observers a way to examine and understand whether an entity (e.g. AI agent) can be considered conscious

</br>

### Social-Self Theory of Consciousness

- Social-Self theory of consciousness does not interpret consciousness as an individual phenomenon rather a *social phenomenon*.

- Following theory focus on *individual acts* within a *social context*

- Environment must exist within which actors communicate with each other.

</br>

### Nagels' Conceptualization of Consciousness

- Organism is conscious when it knows *what it is like to be another organism* 

- Thus, other conscious organisms must exist within the conscious entity's immediate environment to make it possible for conscious organism to experience what it like to be the other.

</br>

#### Symbols

<table>  
    <tr>    
        <td style="border: 0px solid black">
            <b><span style="color:#50C878;">EXAMPLE</spanspan></b>: One can assume that a person intends harm if that person approaches with clenched fist. 
        </td>      
    </tr>
</table> 

`Clenched fist` would be considered symbol that carries same meaning for all involved actors.

Victim will defend itself from imminent attack while initiator will respond to defenders' action. This back-and-forth exchange of symbols constitutes a matrix of social acts or a **social matrix**

Consciousness in social-self theory requires a social matrix consisting of social acts and the exchange of symbols that lead to creation of language. 

</br>

### Observations

- Theory not concerned with mental processess, existence of mind, internal state which is assumed that all actors bear implictly. 

- Entity might know it is conscious, but external observer might not until conscious entity informs the observer.

None of them (Philo-Psychological and Social-Self theory) alone can provide guidance in positively determining whether an entity is conscious.

> Authors put forward the idea that co-creation of the language is one of the missing links to consciousness

## Theories of AI Consciousness

Authors provide 6 propositions regarding AI Consciousness which might help us to formulate or discover a conscious AI agent.

## Service Implications

- With the Conscious AI in pursuit, we would need to necessitate new laws and bring forth concepts such as *AI ethics* and *rights*. 

- Empathic AI may affect the job market for humans, especially at the higher end of the job market in the service industry.

- Empathic AI will also have the ability to change the human-AI relationship as people come to trust AI advice and actions, even in hedonic tasks, over advice and actions from another human.

## Conclusion

Authors have introduced a theoritical framework to identify the requirements by which consciousness can <em>emerge</em> in AI agents along with another aim for AI research and practice contrary to current dominant paradigm of creating machines that are <em>linguistically indistinguishable</em> from humans. We need more research to develop refined techinical criteria to recognize the signs of emergent AI consciousness.
